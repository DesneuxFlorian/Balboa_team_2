# Balboa_team_2
Advanced control 2 balboa robot
As part of the Advanced control 2 course, we did a job in which we were able to choose our own subject with the mobile balboa robot. We opted for subject number 6 "SLAM ROBOT". This subject consists in creating a map of an unknown environment thanks to the remote control of our laptop. The purpose of this documentation is to understand how to reproduce our project and then improve it for the years to come.
